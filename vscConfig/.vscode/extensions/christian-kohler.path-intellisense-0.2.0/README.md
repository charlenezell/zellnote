## Usage

## Ideas
Filesystem api calls are slow. That's why this plugin tries to keep fs access to a minimum. 
I added a few checks before calling the fs api. For more information about this, have a look a the unit tests.

## Settings
### File extension in import statements
Path Intellisense removes the file extension by default if the statement is a import statement. To enable file extensions set the following setting to true:

```javascript
{
	"path-intellisense.extensionOnImport": true,
}
```
